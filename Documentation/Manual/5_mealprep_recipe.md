# Creating a mealprep recipe

In Calorinator, you can consume Ingredients as such, you must specify everything you eat as a recipe.
A recipe is a re-usable instance of one or more ingredients.

In this chapter we'll create what's called a [mealprep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal_preparation).

In calorinator, a mealprep is basically any food that you can take more than single portion of, but that consists of 
more than 1 ingredient.

Each melprep is paired with one or more accompaniments.

The example mealprep we're doing here is a poor man's [Rag√π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rag%C3%B9). 

1. The `Manage Recipes` button in the `Main Menu` will open the `Manage Recipes` sub-menu.
