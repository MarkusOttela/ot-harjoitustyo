# Creating (=Cooking) a Mealprep

Creating the mealprep recipe alone is not enough, we also need to cook the mealprep.

The problem with complex home-cooked food when dieting is often the difficulty of estimating the caloric content.
Calorinator solves this problem by allowing you to specify the amount of each ingredient as you're cooking.
All you need is a kitchen scale.

1. To create a new mealprep into Calorinator, press the `Manage Mealpreps` button in the `Main Menu`.

2. Next, select the mealprep recipe (`Ragu`) created in chapter 5.

3. Next, specify the amount of each ingredient added during cooking.

Make sure to weigh ingredients raw, and to maintain basic hygiene when handling ingredients such as raw meat.

Once you're done, press the `Done` button.
