Selecting the `Daily Overview` will display each meal, their nutritional values such as 
* total kcal
* carbohydrates
* protein
* fat

The `Macros` section will show you your daily consumption in relation to your daily macronutrient goals.

The `Daily calorie balance` section will show you how many calories you have actually consumed once the [TEF](https://examine.com/outcomes/thermic-effect-of-food/) 
(=Energy burned to make food energy available) is removed. You will also see your estimated Basal Metabolic Rate,
i.e. the number of calories your basic metabolic functions consume, and how energy it takes for you to lie on your 
couch the whole day. Based on the ingested food, you will also see whether you're on caloric deficit or surplus, and
you can even see an estimate of how much your body weight will change by 
* nutrition type (`C` for carbohydrates in liver, and `F` for fat all over your body)
* total at the end of the day (`55.0kg -> 54.9kg`)

Once you're done, you can press the <kbd>Esc</kbd> button to return to the `Main Menu`.
